The following is a short story demarked with <<<<<< and >>>>>>s. 

The short story is called "{title}", and aims to have the following categories: {categories}.

Please rate how good you think it is on a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 is the worst and 100 is the best.
Output format should be the number out of 100, followed by a colon and a single sentence reason for the rating.

Examples:
34/100: The story is not coherent and the writing style is poor.
79/100: Interesting sci-fic concepts and some decent character development.

Take into account the following criteria:
- Originality
- Coherence
- Interest
- How well it fits the categories ({categories})
- General writing style
- Consistency
